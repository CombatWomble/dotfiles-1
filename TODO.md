	- trim down as much fat as possible, such as things I don't use anymore
	- look into [these dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles) for sexiness
	- README
		- list dependencies and other relevant installed packages
		- screenshots
- build
	- return to a non-grunt workflow (or at least a fallback)
		- maybe a `Makefile`
		- maybe use [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink management
			- probably not, since it's another dependency
			- if so, fallback to symlinks
	- clone `tpm` (tmux plugin manager) and other dependencies
	- ~~set up a grunt workflow~~
		- `install` - installs things, makes links, etc.
			- migrate current install script
			- anonymous install (no need for git ssh keys, no reference to me)
			- have params for CLI-only or X-supported (don't need to install i3 on a server)
			- possibly make a (generated?) manifest file, to make cleanup easier
			- support anonymous installs, where things like .gitconfig wouldn't be installed
		- `compile`/`config` - generates config files, like `i3`
		- `reinstall`
		- `update` - cleans up old stuff and does the new
		- `remove`/`uninstall`/`cleanup`

			- or make my own, like I did for sublime

		- make a motion for "in/around array/object element"
			- something that could delete not just a thing, but the preceding comma
		- plugins
			- make "put in <motion>" function or plugin
				- definitely call it "Put in motion"
			- [fix easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion/issues/228)

				- I have two commenting plugins, with overlapping but not identical features

		- integrate `tmux-project`
		- make `alt+tab` functionality
			- supposedly this is not possible
	- `tmux`
		- improve projects
			- figure out why vim has weird issues when attaching a certain way
				- colors vs titles (pane navigation)
				- try out an existing project loader, which may solve the above
			- make `tmux-project` support joining a single session (with same windows)
				- using [flags](http://www.bahmanm.com/blogs/command-line-options-how-to-parse-in-bash-using-getopt)

		- mappings
			- make h/l go left/right
				- bind the current h/l to something else
			- scrap
			- stash / pop

				- all
			- checkout tags
				- the main checkout bind should probably just support tags too

		- http://www.noobslab.com/
- `urxvt`
	- get unicode fonts working
- system
	- only run `xcape` over `CapsLock`, not `Control_L`
