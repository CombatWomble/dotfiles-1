- meta
	- add a readme
		- list dependencies and other relevant installed packages
		- screenshots
	- trim down as much fat as possible, such as things I don't use anymore
	- look into [these dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles)
	- set up a grunt workflow
		- use [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink management
		- `install` - installs things, makes links, etc.
			- migrate current install script
			- anonymous install (no need for git ssh keys, no reference to me)
			- have params for CLI-only or X-supported (don't need to install i3 on a server)
			- possibly make a (generated?) manifest file, to make cleanup easier
			- support anonymous installs, where things like .gitconfig wouldn't be installed
		- `compile`/`config` - generates config files, like `i3`
		- `reinstall`
		- `update` - cleans up old stuff and does the new
		- `remove`/`uninstall`/`cleanup`
- apps
	- vim
		- customize airline colors so that visual mode isn't terrible. maybe a vibrant green
		- fix `:TmuxNavigate*` when (in tmux && `v file`)
		- tabs
			- make `[tabs]j` and `[tabs]k` go to first/last tab (or something else)
			- make `[tabs]J` and `[tabs]K` move to first/last (or something else)
		- make "put in <motion>" function or plugin
			- should definitely call it "Put in motion"
		- make `[e` and `]e` keep the selection in visual mode
		- unite
			- make a mapping or mode for finding files not in the repo
			- abstract making 4-8 mappings per concept
			- better previews
				- possibly a dynamic vertical/horizontal choice
	- i3
		- add a (preferably generated) help block for modes
			- either automatically or on `?`
		- generate config, via grunt task outlined above
		- implement project system
		- become more familiar with the other layouts (tabs and stacks)
	- tmux
		- vet corded mappings more
		- explore `command-prompt` possibilities
		- explore `choose-*` possibilities
			- `choose-client`
			- `choose-list`
				- join project from project system, outlined above
			- `choose-session`
				- list of sessions to link to (linked windows/layouts but not focus)
			- `choose-tree`
			- `choose-window`
	- copyq
		- integrate into workflow
		- get more use out of tabs
			- make yanking in vim store items in &vim
			- make images save in &images
			- make URLs save in &URLs
		- make it use my dotfiles color scheme
- shell
	- make sure bash works, even though I haven't used it in years
	- make zsh prompt [change when in command mode](https://github.com/edkolev/promptline.vim/issues/10)
- X
	- fixmon
		- make the fixmon scripts I have check monitors, so it works no matter which environment
- Owmni
	- client-agnostic back-end, which should work with X and terminals alike
	- clients
		- rofi
		- selecta
		- tmux
		- dmenu
	- plugins
		- git
			- `git branch | cut -c 3- | owmni <blah blah> | xargs git checkout`
			- `git branch -r | cut -c 10- | selecta | xargs git checkout`
		- i3
		- apps
		- media
		- computer
		- projects
		- windows
		- finch
			- maybe initiate IMs?
		- email (mutt?)
		- grunt
- misc
	- make tropes/mappings consistent across programs
	- only run `xcape` over CapsLock, not Control_L
		- for some reason this doesn't work as expected, though I'm not sure why
