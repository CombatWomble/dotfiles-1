- meta
	- README
		- list dependencies and other relevant installed packages
		- explain my environment (vim, i3, tmux, arch linux, etc)
		- screenshots
	- trim down as much fat as possible, such as things I don't use anymore
	- look into [these dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles)
- build
	- return to a non-grunt workflow (or at least a fallback)
		- maybe a `Makefile`
		- use [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink management
		- fallback to symlinks
	- ~~set up a grunt workflow~~
		- `install` - installs things, makes links, etc.
			- migrate current install script
			- anonymous install (no need for git ssh keys, no reference to me)
			- have params for CLI-only or X-supported (don't need to install i3 on a server)
			- possibly make a (generated?) manifest file, to make cleanup easier
			- support anonymous installs, where things like .gitconfig wouldn't be installed
		- `compile`/`config` - generates config files, like `i3`
		- `reinstall`
		- `update` - cleans up old stuff and does the new
		- `remove`/`uninstall`/`cleanup`
	- clone `tpm` (tmux plugin manager) and other dependencies
- apps
	- vim
		- [use snippets](https://medium.com/brigade-engineering/sharpen-your-vim-with-snippets-767b693886db)
		- customize airline colors so that visual mode isn't terrible. maybe a vibrant green?
		- make "put in <motion>" function or plugin
			- definitely call it "Put in motion"
		- unite
			- make a mapping or mode for finding files not in the repo
			- abstract making 4-8 mappings per concept
			- better previews
				- possibly a dynamic vertical/horizontal choice
		- make `[e` and `]e` keep the selection in visual mode
			- this is less important since I figured out `.` repeats it correctly
		- make a <localleader> bind to open the session of the current project
		- [figure out analytics](http://www.drbunsen.org/vim-croquet/)
	- i3
		- make `alt+tab` functionality
		- break out modes into separate files
			- add a generated help notification for each mode, on `?`
	- tmux
		- [vet plugins](https://github.com/tmux-plugins)
		- explore `command-prompt` possibilities
		- explore `choose-*` possibilities
			- `choose-client`
			- `choose-session`
				- list of sessions to link to (linked windows/layouts but not focus)
			- `choose-tree`
			- `choose-window`
	- copyq
		- integrate into workflow
		- get more use out of tabs
			- make yanking in vim store items in &vim
			- make images save in &images
			- make URLs save in &URLs
		- make it use my dotfiles color scheme
	- zeal
		- integrate into workflow
		- figure out wtf keeps going wrong with the i3 shortcut, and fix it
- shell
	- change the color of the zsh prompt or something, to make it more obvious
		- when logged in as "root"
		- when on remote computers
	- make sure bash works, even though I haven't used it in years
- X
	- fixmon
		- make the fixmon scripts I have check monitors, so it works no matter which environment
	- figure out a way to run scripts based on boot params
		- namely, allow booting into different xorg-swap modes
	- look into existing `.Xresources` themes
		- http://www.noobslab.com/
- Owmni / Awmni
	- client-agnostic back-end, which should work with X and terminals alike
	- clients
		- rofi
		- selecta
		- dmenu
	- plugins
		- git
			- `git branch | cut -c 3- | owmni <blah blah> | xargs git checkout`
			- `git branch -r | cut -c 10- | selecta | xargs git checkout`
		- i3
		- zeal
		- apps
			- open
			- kill
			- switch to (like `rofi` currently does)
		- media
		- computer
		- projects
			- open tmux panes on certain workspaces, etc
		- windows
		- pidgin / finch
			- initiate IMs
			- switch to opened IMs
			- send a message
		- email (mutt?)
		- grunt
- misc
	- make tropes/mappings consistent across programs
	- only run `xcape` over CapsLock, not Control_L
		- for some reason this doesn't work as expected, though I'm not sure why
