## Workspaces are created simply by adding Workspace-X groups as follows:
#[Workspace-1]
#name = blist
## window-names specifies that windows with these semi-colon separated names are placed into this workspace
#window-names = buddylist;debug-window
#
#[Workspace-2]
#name = IM
#window-names = conversation-window
## window-titles specifies that windows with these semi-colon separated titles are placed into this workspace. These are matched as substrings. Window titles take precedence over names.
