- meta
	- trim down as much fat as possible, such as things I don't use anymore
	- look into [these dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles) for sexiness
	- README
		- list dependencies and other relevant installed packages
		- screenshots
- build
	- return to a non-grunt workflow (or at least a fallback)
		- maybe a `Makefile`
		- maybe use [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink management
			- probably not, since it's another dependency
			- if so, fallback to symlinks
	- clone `tpm` (tmux plugin manager) and other dependencies
	- ~~set up a grunt workflow~~
		- `install` - installs things, makes links, etc.
			- migrate current install script
			- anonymous install (no need for git ssh keys, no reference to me)
			- have params for CLI-only or X-supported (don't need to install i3 on a server)
			- possibly make a (generated?) manifest file, to make cleanup easier
			- support anonymous installs, where things like .gitconfig wouldn't be installed
		- `compile`/`config` - generates config files, like `i3`
		- `reinstall`
		- `update` - cleans up old stuff and does the new
		- `remove`/`uninstall`/`cleanup`
- apps
	- vim
		- make "put in <motion>" function or plugin
			- definitely call it "Put in motion"
		- organize modules such that there's no separation between (most) plugins and user modules
			- `vim-windowswap` in `window`
			- `vim-fugitive` and `vim-gitgutter` in `git`
		- [use snippets](https://medium.com/brigade-engineering/sharpen-your-vim-with-snippets-767b693886db)
			- or make my own, like I did for sublime
		- make a <localleader> bind to open the session of the current project
		- modes
			- ember
			- vifm
				- https://github.com/vifm/vifm/issues/60 and https://github.com/vifm/vifm/issues/79
			- unite
				- better previews
					- possibly a dynamic vertical/horizontal choice
				- make a mapping or mode for finding files not in the repo
				- abstract making 4-8 mappings per concept
				- vim-session integration
		- Raws, Private Investigator
			- figure out why reloading vimrc makes exiting insert mode laggy
			- figure out why `[s` lags
		- sync sessions
		- consider migrating to its own repo
		- [figure out analytics](http://www.drbunsen.org/vim-croquet/)
		- I _think_ this might be working now that I included `tmux-plugins/vim-tmux-focus-events`
			- ~~figure out a way to reload/update buffers automatically~~
				- ~~changed files~~
				- ~~deleted files~~
				- ~~moved files~~
	- i3
		- blocks
			- disks
				- combine all disks into one
				- show all mounted disks (parse `lsblk`)
				- scroll to cycle
				- maintains state
		- locally override settings (namely font size)
		- get current tag
			- open tmux session for current tag
		- break out modes into separate files
			- add a generated help notification for each mode, on `?`
		- add clipboard management
		- universalize the media/resize/move increments and whatnot
			- make sure there are mappings for both big and small increments
		- integrate `tmux-project`
		- make `alt+tab` functionality
			- supposedly this is not possible
	- tmux
		- improve projects
			- figure out why vim has weird issues when attaching a certain way
				- colors vs titles (pane navigation)
				- try out an existing project loader, which may solve the above
			- make `tmux-project` support joining a single session (with same windows)
				- using [flags](http://www.bahmanm.com/blogs/command-line-options-how-to-parse-in-bash-using-getopt)
			- make a "kill" or "clean" project, which kills tmux sessions
		- explore `command-prompt` possibilities
		- explore `choose-*` possibilities
			- `choose-client`
			- `choose-session`
				- list of sessions to link to (linked windows/layouts but not focus)
			- `choose-tree`
			- `choose-window`
	- tig
		- spend time making it even more useful
		- investigate [wiki binds](https://github.com/jonas/tig/wiki/Bindings)
	- copyq
		- integrate into workflow
		- get more use out of tabs
			- make yanking in vim store items in &vim
			- make images save in &images
			- make URLs save in &URLs
		- make it use my dotfiles color scheme
	- zeal
		- integrate into workflow
		- figure out wtf keeps going wrong with the i3 shortcut, and fix it
	- vifm
		- add bind to essentially run `fasd`
		- revisit binds
		- add specific configs, launched with `-c "source /path/to/config"`
			- tmux
			- vim
	- tig
		- get `pick` working
		- make either `pick` or `selecta` support direct user input
			- https://github.com/thoughtbot/pick/issues/58
			- https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta/issues/64
		- mappings
			- scrap
			- stash / pop
				- per file
				- all
			- checkout tags
				- the main checkout bind should probably just support tags too
	- spacefm
		- plugins
	- cvim
		- vet using local script
- shell
	- modularize `.zshrc`
		- make semantic modules instead of a file for aliases and a file for functions
	- revisit aliases
		- like `h`
		- introduce `ls -1`
	- use `local` variables
		- like why the hell don't they work like the Internet says they should?
	- (yank to clipboard)[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25765/pasting-from-clipboard-to-vi-enabled-zsh-or-bash-shell]
	- make cursor changes update when focus changes (between tmux panes with vim and zsh)
	- make sure bash works, even though I haven't used it in years
- X
	- modularize `.Xresources`
	- look into existing `.Xresources` themes
		- http://www.noobslab.com/
- system
	- only run `xcape` over `CapsLock`, not `Control_L`
		- for some reason this doesn't work as expected, though I'm not sure why
	- monitors
		- handle hot-plugging monitors
		- make monitors not enter standby when WE'RE WATCHING A SHOW, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
- Owmni / Awmni
	- client-agnostic back-end, which should work with X and terminals alike
