	- trim down as much fat as possible, such as things I don't use anymore
	- look into [these dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles) for sexiness
	- README
		- screenshots
- build
	- return to a non-grunt workflow (or at least a fallback)
		- maybe a `Makefile`
		- maybe use [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink management
			- probably not, since it's another dependency
			- if so, fallback to symlinks
	- clone `tpm` (tmux plugin manager) and other dependencies
	- ~~set up a grunt workflow~~
		- `install` - installs things, makes links, etc.
			- migrate current install script
			- anonymous install (no need for git ssh keys, no reference to me)
			- have params for CLI-only or X-supported (don't need to install i3 on a server)
			- possibly make a (generated?) manifest file, to make cleanup easier
			- support anonymous installs, where things like .gitconfig wouldn't be installed
		- `compile`/`config` - generates config files, like `i3`
		- `reinstall`
		- `update` - cleans up old stuff and does the new
		- `remove`/`uninstall`/`cleanup`
- apps
	- `vim`
		- change prefix maps so as to not interfere with `[` mappings
		- vet [tab indents with space alignment](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces)
		- plugins
			- make "put in <motion>" plugin
			- [fix easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion/issues/228)
			- remove redundant or unused plugins
				- I have two commenting plugins, with overlapping but not identical features
			- [zeal](https://github.com/KabbAmine/zeavim.vim)
		- make a <localleader> bind to open the session of the current project
		- modes
			- ember
			- vifm
				- https://github.com/vifm/vifm/issues/60 and https://github.com/vifm/vifm/issues/79
			- unite
				- better previews
					- possibly a dynamic vertical/horizontal choice
				- make a mapping or mode for finding files not in the repo
				- abstract making 4-8 mappings per concept
				- vet mappings per concept, as some do weird things (`[unite:1]g`)
				- vim-session integration
			- vimfiler
				- make mappings
				- [add git status icons](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim/issues/308)
		- Raws, Private Investigator
			- figure out why reloading vimrc makes exiting insert mode laggy
		- [look into analytics](http://www.drbunsen.org/vim-croquet/)
	- `i3`
		- modes
			- config
				- toggle wifi, bluetooth
			- break out modes into separate files
				- add a generated help notification for each mode, on `?`
		- locally override settings (namely font size)
		- get current tag
			- open tmux session for current tag
		- add clipboard management
		- universalize the media/resize/move increments and whatnot
			- make sure there are mappings for both big and small increments
		- integrate `tp`
		- make `alt+tab` functionality
			- supposedly this is not possible
			- could possibly prefix navigation options with `mL`, and make `alt+tab` run `"L`
	- `tmux`
		- Raws, Private Investigator
			- figure out why exiting one session sometimes switches to another
		- use `choose-session` to pick a session to link current session to
	- `tig`
		- spend time making it even more useful
		- universalize mappings
		- investigate [wiki binds](https://github.com/jonas/tig/wiki/Bindings)
		- mappings
			- make h/l go left/right
				- bind the current h/l to something else
			- scrap
			- stash / pop
				- per file
				- all
			- checkout tags
				- the main checkout bind should probably just support tags too
	- `copyq`
		- make it use my dotfiles theme
		- figure out why URLs are duplicated
	- `zeal`
		- integrate into workflow
		- figure out wtf keeps going wrong with the i3 shortcut, and fix it
	- `vifm`
		- add bind to essentially run `fasd`
		- revisit binds
		- add specific configs, launched with `-c "source /path/to/config"`
			- tmux
			- vim
	- `spacefm`
		- plugins
	- `cvim`
		- vet using local script
- shell
	- refactor `.zshrc`
		- modularize
			- make semantic modules instead of a file for aliases and a file for functions (for example)
		- look into [built-in functions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/tree/master/Functions/Zle)
		- look into [better status indicator](http://ivyl.0xcafe.eu/2013/02/03/refining-zsh/#vi_mode_status_indicator)
	- revisit aliases
		- like `h` and co.
		- introduce `ls -1`
	- use `local` variables
		- like why the hell don't they work like the Internet says they should?
	- [yank to clipboard](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25765/pasting-from-clipboard-to-vi-enabled-zsh-or-bash-shell)
	- make cursor changes update when focus changes (between tmux panes with vim and zsh)
	- make sure bash works, even though I haven't used it in years
- X
	- modularize `.Xresources`
	- use something better than `grp:shifts_toggle` in `keys`
	- look into existing `.Xresources` themes
		- http://www.noobslab.com/
- `urxvt`
	- get unicode fonts working
- system
	- only run `xcape` over `CapsLock`, not `Control_L`
		- for some reason this doesn't work as expected, though I'm not sure why
	- monitors
		- handle hot-plugging monitors
		- make monitors not enter standby when WE'RE WATCHING A SHOW, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
- Owmni / Awmni
	- client-agnostic back-end, which should work with X and terminals alike
	- clients
		- rofi
